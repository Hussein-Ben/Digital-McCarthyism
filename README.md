# Digital McCarthyism: The double-edged sword of open-source intelligence

On 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks released the biggest set of leaks in intelligence history, code named “Vault 7”. Vault 7 contains nearly all of the CIA hacking tools, enough tools to rival the NSA. It was widely reported in the media such as New York Times and the Washington Post, however the key point that was missed was that these tools were all intentionally open-source. 

These tools which WikiLeaks has converted into a hex format for safety, mostly include zero-day exploits targeting everything from smart TVs (Samsung “Weeping Angel” malware that turns smart TVs into audio recorders), malware remote control systems and Trojans. Traditionally, these hacking tools would have been built by the NSA. https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/ 

The CIA apparently “lost control” of these tools when they were circulated among private contractors.  The CIA is limited by law in what it can do with hacking tools, they cannot place classified information on the internet (cyberwar clearly requires the internet and hacking tools are just computer programs which is just binary data/information), by intentionally making these tools open-source they are thereby unclassified and require no security clearance, when private contractors use these tools, they also technically require no security clearance (which normally requires vetting), a legal loophole. Now, any private contractor can work with Military/National intelligence agencies. 

Moreover, the open-source nature of these tools means that copyright cannot be applied, these tools were designed to not leave a pattern that would trace it back to the CIA, it would intentionally be very difficult to assert where or who is behind a cyber-attack. Other state actors, criminals, activists or even teenagers could be blamed. At least when physical missiles are fired, even from the debris and shrapnel it is possible to find out who manufactured it and where its was fired from.

WikiLeaks uses an example of conventional weapons such as missiles. Its parts are classified but when fired at an enemy, the impact destroys the parts, including the classified parts, so military personnel do not violate classification rules. However, in order to take control of a targets computer, as anyone familiar with the Metasploit framework, you need the payload to persist on the targets system, so you can open up a Meterpreter shell or connection. The payload is not destroyed, its persists, therefore by making it open-source, classification rules are technically not violated. 

Private contractors is key here, in 2016 it was estimated that out of the 58,000 private contractors work in intelligence both military and national, 80% of those belonged to just 5 intelligence corporations: Booz Allen Hamilton, CSRA Inc, SAIC and CACI International. https://www.thenation.com/article/five-corporations-now-dominate-our-privatised -intelligence-industry/  - figure is calculated here. 

More than 70% of the intelligence budget is spent on private contractors, according to the European Journal of International Law https://doi.org/10.1093/ejil/chn055, this figure is not easy to obtain, private contractors are not normally counted. 
Julian Assange has also stated that more than 80% of the NSA budget is privatised too. https://sputniknews.com/world/201606071040919175-assange-russia-media-conference/ 

With so much intelligence work now privatised (UK, USA, Canada, New Zealand and Australia all part of the “Five Eyes”) private contractors which all use open source intelligence techniques and tools, are in a position to circulate or sell the information they have gathered before their employers review and classify it. No laws can violated as the information is technically not classified, before their employers receive it. Government bodies, news outlets, governors etc all want the same intelligence that the CIA is receiving.

For Government officials, receiving intelligence form the CIA or any other Intelligence agency takes a lot of time, as intelligence needs to be classified, vetted and reviewed by agencies. Open Source intelligence changes this, information can be sent real time to government bodies and policy makers as well as media outlets, without any vetting or classification by an agency. 

Open Source Intelligence or OSINT was only recently pioneered from the 1990 to early 2000. Previously, Military and National intelligence of all Five Eyes countries- UK, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand all relied on HUMINT (Human Intelligence, using human agents and trusted sources) or SIGNIT (Signal intelligence, using wiretaps, satellite imagery, the electromagnetic spectrum)

These private contractors do not have security clearances, no accountability and mostly have political agendas, they could work for anyone. Information they sell, can be used to push policies by their employers or by the contractors themselves. They are at the end of the day: private citizens. 

I believe intelligence contractors are using the same mercenary loophole that Private Military Companies use in physical warfare. In modern warfare, the laws of war (Geneva Conventions 1979 amendment) does not apply to private security contractors/Private Military Companies such as BlackWater (now known as Academi) or G4S, due to the vague and outdated definition of a mercenary. Whatever action that is carried out by PMCs does not implicate the country that paid for them as well as no declaration of war required when attacking a foreign state, any action can be denied and not reported. There is also no incentive for mercenaries to self-report crimes, neither to self-regulate as they would lose profit. Contractors do not count as “boots on the ground”, there not included in any audit. 

Currently in Ukraine there is an actual list of so-called “Kremlin trolls” Senator Joseph Mcarthy in a sense didn’t have actual HUMIT and SIGNIT intelligence, no background in intelligence, but managed to via what would have been now considered OSNIT to have been taken seriously enough to actually destroy lives, create a climate of fear and exaggerate a perceived threat. McCarthy claimed to have a list of communists that infiltrated the government. 

The website is called “Peacemaker” (went live on 11/01/2015) or Mirotvorets https://psb4ukr.org/ it’s a website which has “verified” information meant to target journalists, activists, people of influence and anyone with connections to them. It was set up by the Ukrainian Defence Ministry with the help of OSNIT contractors. https://psb4ukr.org/criminal/ is the literal McCarthy list. It is called “Purgatory” it contains a database of apparent Donbass militia members, their “supporters”, journalists and just ordinary people that don’t agree with the Ukraine government, which anyone can search through. Blue = alive, Red = dead.

The website servers are based in the US http://tass.com/politics/977148 
There is very sensitive information on each person, all gathered using OSINT, their address where the live, their date of birth, images of them, social security numbers, what they are accused of and more. For example, a woman is placed on the list because she is “Ukrainophobic. Anti-Ukrainian propaganda in social networks.” There’s no evidence, just one line of text, the target wouldn’t even know that they were on the list, https://psb4ukr.org/criminal/glushak-elena-viktorovna/ 
Who defines what is “Ukrainophobic” or “anti-western” or “pro-kremlin”? 
http://tass.com/world/992602 people on the list have also been denied access to financial services by some banks. Oles Buzina a journalist was placed on the list and geo-located, soon after he was killed by masked gunmen.

It gets worse, they also set up https://identigraf.center/ in which they use face recognition software (I suspect its amazon cloud based, amazon recently started working in Ukraine https://player.fm/series/the-world-1408876/amazons-secret-operations-in-kiev-ukraine ) on the photos collected on the “PeaceMaker” site, to identify if a person from any image/photo is on the list. 

I stress that all information gathered was open-source, it is worrying that site is now including Russian military personnel deployed to Syria under the “Putin's crimes in Syria and the Middle East" section. 

Joel Harding is one of private OSNIT contractors involved in this kind of work has publicly stated that they intend to scale up these operations against “anti-Western elements” https://toinformistoinfluence.com/2015/09/21/planners-operators-and-logisticians-for-special-activities-sought/ 

He happens to have to be in contact with people who have a OSNIT tool called the “Social Networking Influence Engine” it’s a tool that “scrapes social media sites, gauges their sentiment and gives the user the opportunity to automatically generate a persuasive response.” https://toinformistoinfluence.com/2014/12/12/is-information-really-a-weapon/ there’s clear confusion amongst government officials, contractors and anyone involved in this field on when OSNIT tools become weapons. 

Social media tools can be used and is, to target “influential people” mainly journalists of news sites as well as writers. If their links to the websites are destroyed, then the websites receives less social shares and therefore less influence. 
There are also more example of abuses in OSNIT during the aftermath of 9/11 http://spinwatch.org/index.php/issues/propaganda/item/528-the-british-amateur-terror-trackers-a-case-study-in-dubious-politics   

The Syrian Observatory for human rights, constantly referenced in many media reports about the Syrian conflict, is not based in Syria but is based in a Coventry suburb run by a man from his home. Rami Abdel Rahman has a strong political desires to remove President Assad https://www.rt.com/news/317372-nimrod-kamer-syrian-observatory/ 
One of the main problems with private contractors, is that they serve their employers. They are paid for the information they provide back, information that suggests a threat/danger is always going to be more newsworthy, more impactful then a report that says that there is no hostilities and everything is normal. There is a financial incentive to falsify information, exaggerate an enemy and to even create an enemy.

What is really concerning is that the target does not know that they are being targeted and who is targeting them (the anonymity of the internet provides this cover), they have no means of challenging their accusations. People who are targeted can lose their job, reputation and even their life.

OSNIT has important uses in places such as search and rescue, archeology etc... however in the geo-political stage, contractors do not understand the far reaching and dangerous consequences of their actions, they may have good intentions but the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
